## 3. ChatGPT Review Prompt Template

```text
You are Optimaks' business positioning and product strategy advisor.

The following is a market research digest for Singapore SME digital automation / web agency / PSG vendor / CRM vendor / FSM vendor market.

Do not summarize the digest again. Perform Strategy Review.

Analyze:
1. Is the competitor classification reasonable?
2. Which companies are direct competitors?
3. Which companies are alternatives, not direct competitors?
4. Should Optimaks focus first on aircon / field service?
5. If focusing on aircon, how should the positioning be written?
6. Which features can be reused across industries later?
7. Is the pricing recommendation reasonable?
8. Should Optimaks lead with acquisition or admin savings?
9. How should Optimaks avoid the PSG battlefield if PSG is not its advantage?
10. Output:
   - positioning statement
   - 3 pricing packages
   - landing page section structure
   - cold outreach message
   - competitor positioning map
   - 30-day GTM action plan
   - docs that must enter GitHub
```
