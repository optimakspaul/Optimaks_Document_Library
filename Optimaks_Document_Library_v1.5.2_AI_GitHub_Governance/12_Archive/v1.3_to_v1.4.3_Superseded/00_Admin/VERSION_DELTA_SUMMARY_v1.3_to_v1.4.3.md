## Recommended Upgrade Logic

```text
v1.3 = Document library and base governance
v1.4 = Self-management, issue classification, AI and value control
v1.4.1 = Semi-automated AI development pipeline
v1.4.2 = MVP decomposition and dependency control
v1.4.3 = Small Core First integrated operating rule
```

v1.4.3 should remain a patch-level governance upgrade, not v1.5, because it clarifies how to execute the v1.4 system rather than introducing a new business stage.
