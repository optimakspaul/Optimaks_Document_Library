## Prompt Template

```text
You are working on the repository: [repo name].

Current issue:
ISSUE-___: [Issue title]

Branch:
[feature/issue-xxx-short-name]

Read these documents first:
- [doc 1]
- [doc 2]
- [doc 3]

Research / handoff context, if applicable:
- Gemini Research Digest used: [Yes / No]
- ChatGPT review completed: [Yes / No]
- Do not use raw Gemini digest as implementation scope. Use only the approved AI Context Package and GitHub Issue.

Constitution rules:
- Small Core First
- Workflow First
- One Core + Industry Template
- No scope expansion without Change Request
- Staging Test before Production Deploy
- No AI-generated code directly into main
- No raw Research Digest directly into implementation
- No secrets / client sensitive data in AI prompts

Scope:
[Clearly list what this issue should do.]

Do not do:
[Clearly list excluded features and files / modules that should not be changed.]

Acceptance criteria:
[Paste acceptance criteria from GitHub Issue.]

Testing required:
[List commands and manual tests.]

After implementation, return:
- changed files
- commands run
- test result
- assumptions
- unresolved risks
- whether CHANGELOG / docs need update
```

Codex: backend, database, auth, RLS, CRUD, logic.
Antigravity: UI, layout, navigation, shared components, responsive, browser verification.
Gemini: research intake / large document digest only.
ChatGPT: scope, CR, research review, issue refinement, prompt, QA, documentation.
```
