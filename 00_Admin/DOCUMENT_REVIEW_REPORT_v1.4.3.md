## 1. Executive Summary

The document library structure is usable and directionally correct. The biggest issue was not the content concept, but version hygiene: several entry files still identified the package as v1.3 even though the library already included v1.4, v1.4.1, v1.4.2, and v1.4.3 materials.

This review package corrected the root README, folder README files, admin README, changelog header, version history header, document index, and one template heading typo.

## 2. Changes Applied in This Package

| Area | Action Taken |
|---|---|
| Root README | Rewritten as `Optimaks Document Library v1.4.3 Integrated`. |
| Folder README files | Rewritten to remove stale v1.3-only language and explain folder purpose. |
| `00_Admin/README.md` | Updated to identify active v1.4.3 files and mark v1.3 single-file backup as historical. |
| `DOC-INDEX-001_Document_Index.md` | Regenerated to include v1.4–v1.4.3 additions and all current files. |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Added v1.4.3 Integrated entry and updated current version metadata. |
| `VERSION_HISTORY.md` | Updated current version metadata and appended v1.4–v1.4.3 lineage summary. |
| `TPL-DEV-008_MVP_Decomposition_Template.md` | Fixed title from `TPL-DEV-007` to `TPL-DEV-008`. |

## 3. Duplicate / Overlap Review

The following overlaps are expected and mostly acceptable because the library separates rules, templates, and checklists. However, several areas should be cleaned up in the next minor version.

| Area | Current Files | Review | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| README duplication | All folder README files | Previously repetitive and stale. | Fixed in this package. |
| Change Request flow | `STD-DEV-004`, `CHANGE_REQUEST_Template.md`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/change_request.md` | Overlap is acceptable: one is policy, one is working template, one is GitHub issue template. | Keep all three, but cross-link them in v1.5. |
| AI prompt / context package | `STD-DEV-011`, `STD-DEV-015`, `STD-DEV-018`, `CODEX_TASK_PROMPT_Template.md`, `TPL-DEV-007` | Some repetition exists around what an AI prompt must contain. | Fuse into a single `AI Context Package Standard` in v1.5, while keeping templates separate. |
| MVP decomposition | `STD-DEV-016`, `STD-DEV-017`, `TPL-DEV-008`, `10_Projects/_Templates/00_MVP_Dependency_Map_TEMPLATE.md` | Overlap is useful but can become confusing. | Keep `STD-DEV-016` as decomposition policy, `STD-DEV-017` as execution rule, templates as working documents. Add explicit cross-links. |
| Small Core / MVP integration | `STD-DEV-010`, `STD-DEV-016`, `STD-DEV-017` | These are related but not identical. | In v1.5, rename or clarify: `STD-DEV-010` = module integration, `016` = decomposition, `017` = execution sequence. |
| Monthly value | `FND-003`, `STD-DEV-019`, `CLT-006` | Currently repeated across foundation, standard, and delivery report. | Keep principle in `STD-DEV-019`, service model summary in `FND-003`, and report format in `CLT-006`. Avoid copying the same list in all three. |
| QA / Security / PDPA | `STD-DEV-009`, `QA-001`, `PDPA-001`, `LEG-005` | Overlap is normal: policy, checklist, and legal notice serve different purposes. | Keep, but add “policy vs checklist vs notice” distinction in v1.5. |
| Deployment | `STD-DEV-007`, `DEP-001` | Overlap is normal. | Keep: standard explains principle; checklist is execution. |
| Handover | `CLT-005`, `HAN-001` | Overlap is normal. | Keep: guide explains; checklist verifies. |
| Changelog vs Version History vs Version Delta | `CHANGELOG.md`, `VERSION_HISTORY.md`, `VERSION_DELTA_SUMMARY_v1.3_to_v1.4.3.md` | Similar but different purpose. | Keep all. Changelog = changes, history = narrative, delta = quick comparison. |
| Full single-file references | `REFERENCE_FULL_SINGLE_FILE_v1.3.md`, `REFERENCE_FULL_SINGLE_FILE_v1.4.3.md` | v1.3 reference can confuse active use. | Keep but mark v1.3 as archive, or move to `00_Admin/archive/` in v1.5. |

## 4. Recommended Deletions

No immediate deletion is required for v1.4.3. The current package is better treated as an integration snapshot.

For v1.5 cleanup, consider moving or archiving:

1. `00_Admin/REFERENCE_FULL_SINGLE_FILE_v1.3.md` → move to `00_Admin/archive/`.
2. Old file tree snapshots that are no longer accurate → keep only latest or move old snapshots to archive.
3. Any future duplicate one-off patch documents after their content has been merged into the active standards.

## 5. Recommended Fusions for v1.5

| Proposed v1.5 Fusion | Files to Review | Intended Result |
|---|---|---|
| AI Context Package Standard | `STD-DEV-011`, `STD-DEV-015`, `STD-DEV-018`, `TPL-DEV-007` | One master standard for what must be attached before AI coding. |
| MVP Execution Standard | `STD-DEV-010`, `STD-DEV-016`, `STD-DEV-017` | Cleaner separation of module architecture, MVP decomposition, and small-core execution. |
| Monthly Value Standard | `FND-003`, `STD-DEV-019`, `CLT-006` | Avoid repeating the same monthly value list across multiple documents. |
| Client Delivery Readiness Standard | `STD-DEV-019`, `CLT-005`, `DEP-001`, `QA-001`, `PDPA-001`, `HAN-001` | One clear path from internal MVP to client-ready delivery. |
| Version Governance Standard | `STD-DEV-014`, `VERSION_HISTORY.md`, `ROADMAP-001` | Cleaner rule for when to use patch/minor/major versions. |

---

## 6. Recommended Amendments

1. Add cross-links between policy documents and their templates/checklists.
2. Add a short “active vs historical” label to archived reference files.
3. Add a `11_Roadmap/README.md` if the roadmap folder remains active.
4. Add a project-specific MVP folder under `10_Projects` when MVP_01 becomes active.
5. Consider changing the next formal version from v1.4.3 to v1.5, because several v1.4.3 rules are formal operating rules rather than small wording patches.

---

## 7. Final Review Judgment

The library is ready to use after the README and index fixes in this package.

The current structure should not be aggressively deleted yet. The best next step is to use v1.4.3 Integrated in real development, then perform a v1.5 cleanup after one or two actual MVP cycles.
